# RAFT CLI
`raft.py` is Rest API Fuzz Testing service CLI that is used for deployment of the
service to Azure, job creation, deletion, etc. See full documentation [RAFT CLI reference](../docs/cli-reference.md)

`raft_local.py` is a script that does not require Azure to run RAFT job configurations. 
See documentation on how to use [RAFT on your development machine](../docs/how-to-use-raft-local.md)
