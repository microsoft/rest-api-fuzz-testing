#### zap/running-against-raft

In this sample, the job description JSON will cause RAFT to execute ZAP against the
RAFT service itself, defining a common file share called **raft**. This can be helpful
when you want to collect results from multiple job runs under a single file share. 

You can run the sample by calling `python run.py`.
