# Validating your installation

Once your deployment has completed, you can check to see if the service is running by
executing the CLI command:

`python raft.py service info`

This will return information about the service including the version of the service installed and the date and time the service was last started.

There are a number of samples in the sample folder. These are setup so that you can run
the python scripts directly to exercise the service. Take some time to look at the log files and
get familiar with the output.
