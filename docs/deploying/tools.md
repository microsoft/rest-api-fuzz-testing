# Tools deployed by default

Two tools are deployed by default. [RESTler](https://github.com/microsoft/restler) and [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/).

You can see their configuration under the `cli/raft-utils/tools` folder.

See an explanation of the `config.json` file in [How a job executes](../how-it-works/how-a-job-executes.md).
