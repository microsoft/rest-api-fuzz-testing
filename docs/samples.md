# RAFT Sample Configurations

We have included a number of sample job definitions, and python scripts
in with the CLI package.

We hope that you take advantage of them to evaluate RAFT's operation,
or as templates for automating RESTler, ZAP and Dredd, or any additional tools
you might want to [onboard](how-to-onboard-a-tool.md).

The samples are located in the **cli/samples** folder under the root of
the RAFT repo, and are organized into three folders:  **Zap**, **RESTler**, **Dredd**,
and **multiple-tools**, the latter of which shows how to execute more than
one tool in a single job. Each sample folder includes it's own `readme.md` file explaining what the sample is about and how to run it.
